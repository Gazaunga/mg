# Mg

This is my fork of the OpenBSD `mg` text editor.

## Changes

removed weird behaviour with brackets that I don't like
changed some keybindings

### Changes coming soon
making it so that only using `C-w` modifies the kill ring. I don't want `M-d` or `M-<backspace>` or `C-k` or anything to mess with the kill ring. I just want them to delete what they're meant to.
